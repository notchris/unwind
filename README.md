***Why?***

There are many amazing libraries that provide components, additional features, and even entire themes for tailwind. The goal of unwind is to provide basic variants of these common components that can be easily customized to fit your needs.

## Usage

As long as you have tailwind setup in your project, you should be good to go. There are some examples that include form elements. For these to display nicely we recommend adding [@tailwindcss/forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) for consistent input style resets.
